    <h2>Mission</h2>
    <p>Impakter Index’s vision is to find the true impact companies have on the world, enabling us to make better choices. 
      Our aim is to use our 4-pillar rating methodology to determine the sustainability of the companies you buy from, work for,
       or invest in, as a way to highlight the world’s positive contributors. We are part of the movement towards an impact economy 
       that focuses on purpose alongside profit.
