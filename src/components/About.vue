    <p>Inform about sustainability by bridging the gap between knowledge hub and the public since 2014,
       we informs and inspires while providing experts with a key place to make themselves heard, exchange 
       information and share their knowledge with the public. In times of fake news, IMPAKTER acts as a safe harbour for 
       data-driven knowledge transfer.

    <p>Boost sustainability by matching sustainable companies with investors and key stakeholders.  
      Our business hub was created in 2018 during the UN SDGs Finance event in Geneve with the aim to bring together SDGs
       focused startups,  like-minded impact investors and industry experts. It acts as a booster for green business
        and supports Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) through special communication and training tools (Impakter4Business).
